<p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is the U.S. Department of Energy's primary national laboratory for
renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. Learn about our mission, values, and key facts.</p>

<p><b>NREL's Mission</b></p>

<p>NREL develops renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices, advances related science and engineering,
and transfers knowledge and innovations to address the nation's energy and environmental goals.</p>
<p>Our emphasis is on a comprehensive energy approach that encompasses the relationship among key systems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fuel production</li>
	<li>Transportation</li>
	<li>The built environment</li>
	<li>Electricity generation and delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>This systems integration approach will accelerate the transformation of our nation's energy use and delivery systems.</p>
<p>Our focus is on a clean energy future.</p>

<p><b>A Model of Sustainability</b></p>

<p>At NREL, we operate sustainably. We are committed to leading the way as a global model for sustainability and our work is
held to the highest environment, health, safety, and quality standards.</p>

<p>Our 327-acre main campus in Golden, Colorado, houses four LEED-rated buildings. The laboratory also operates the National
Wind Technology Center near Boulder, Colorado.</p>

<p><b>Partnerships</b></p>

<p>NREL is the principal research laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
The laboratory is managed for EERE by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, a partnership between Battelle and MRIGlobal.</p>

<p>NREL also conducts research for DOE's Office of Science and Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.
We partner with private industry, academia, and government. Learn about ways to work with us.</p>
